## Toy Programming Language

I wanted to learn about programming languages, so I created a very simple toy language using python which tokenizes some text, turns the list of tokens into an AST, then evaluates it. The code is written to be a bit verbose in places for clarityâ€™s sake. 

Language features:
* Functions!
* Set and Get Variables!
* If and Else!
* Math!
* True and False!
* Printing!

Files:
* `tokenizer.py` - The tokenizer code
* `ast_parser.py` - The parser/AST code
* `lang.py` - The evaluator and code which runs the test code
* `test_code.test` - The test code
